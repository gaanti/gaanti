My name is Anton, Iâ€™m experienced full-stack developer with experience of team management and technical expertise in React, TypeScript, Redux Toolkit, Material UI, and Java Spring frameworks. I proven track record of developing web-interfaces, implementing login and register functionality, working with MySQL databases, integrating payment systems, connecting to cloud services.

I strongly believe that teamwork is the key to delivering high-quality software products in both programming and business. I have learned this through my experience of
1. Managing a team for a growing product at Dynasty Dance Clubs 
2. As an intern student at Stanford University.

Furthermore, one of the most important abilities a worker can have is the capacity to produce positive results and make the right decisions in stressful situations. Living and working in Ukraine during wartime has developed and strengthened these values for me. Therefore, my employers value me for these qualities, and I expect the same from my employees.
